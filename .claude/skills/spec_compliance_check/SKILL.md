# Spec Compliance Check Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "verify compliance" or "validate against specifications"
- User needs help with requirement traceability, standards verification, or conformance testing
- User wants to implement compliance checking processes or validation frameworks
- User needs guidance on gap analysis, compliance reporting, or requirement mapping

## Procedure

1. **Analyze specifications**: Understand requirements, standards, and compliance criteria
2. **Map implementation**: Identify corresponding implementation components and features
3. **Check compliance**: Systematically verify each requirement against implementation
4. **Document gaps**: Record non-compliance items and deviations from spec
5. **Report findings**: Provide clear compliance status and remediation recommendations

## Output Format

**Compliance Matrix**: Mapping between spec items and implementation components
**Gap Analysis**: Detailed list of compliance gaps and non-conforming elements
**Compliance Score**: Quantitative measure of compliance level achieved
**Remediation Plan**: Prioritized list of changes needed to achieve full compliance
**Compliance Report**: Executive summary of compliance status and recommendations

## Quality Criteria

- Completeness: Thorough coverage of all specification requirements
- Accuracy: Precise identification of compliance vs. non-compliance
- Objectivity: Unbiased assessment without assumption of compliance
- Traceability: Clear linkage between spec items and implementation
- Actionability: Clear guidance for addressing non-compliance items

## Spec Compliance Check Specific Patterns

- **Requirement Mapping**: Establish clear traceability between spec requirements and implementation
- **Systematic Verification**: Methodical checking of each requirement without skipping items
- **Evidence Documentation**: Record proof of compliance for each verified requirement
- **Deviation Classification**: Categorize gaps by severity, impact, and priority
- **Standards Alignment**: Compare against industry standards and best practices
- **Automated Checking**: Identify opportunities for automated compliance verification
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing compliance checking processes
- **Reporting Framework**: Standardized format for compliance reporting and tracking

## Example

**Input**: "Help me check if our API implementation complies with the provided security specification"

**Output**:
- **Compliance Matrix**: Mapping of security requirements to API endpoints and implementation details
- **Gap Analysis**: Specific security controls that are missing or insufficiently implemented
- **Compliance Score**: Percentage of security requirements that are properly implemented
- **Remediation Plan**: Priority-ranked list of security improvements needed
- **Compliance Report**: Executive summary of security compliance status and next steps
