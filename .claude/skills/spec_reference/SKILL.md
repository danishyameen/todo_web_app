# Specification Reference Skill

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "implement a feature based on spec" or "follow requirements document"
- User needs help with interpreting ambiguous requirements or technical specifications
- User wants to validate implementation against spec compliance or requirements traceability
- User needs guidance on spec-driven development, acceptance criteria, or requirement mapping

## Procedure

1. **Analyze specifications**: Understand requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria
2. **Map requirements**: Connect spec items to implementation tasks and test cases
3. **Interpret ambiguities**: Clarify unclear requirements and document assumptions
4. **Implement with fidelity**: Build features that precisely match specification
5. **Validate compliance**: Verify implementation against original requirements

## Output Format

**Requirements Analysis**: Breakdown of spec items with priority and dependencies
**Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach to fulfill each requirement
**Traceability Matrix**: Mapping between spec items and implementation components
**Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions for verifying compliance
**Compliance Report**: Assessment of implementation against original spec

## Quality Criteria

- Accuracy: Faithful implementation of all specified requirements
- Completeness: Address all functional and non-functional requirements
- Clarity: Clear mapping between spec and implementation
- Traceability: Documented connection between requirements and code
- Validation: Verification that implementation meets all criteria

## Spec Reference Specific Patterns

- **Requirement Parsing**: Extract functional, non-functional, and constraint requirements
- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Identify unclear requirements and seek clarification
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define measurable, testable conditions for each requirement
- **Implementation Mapping**: Link spec items to specific code components and modules
- **Compliance Checking**: Systematic verification against original specifications
- **Change Management**: Track spec modifications and update implementation accordingly
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing requirements or implementation gaps
- **Verification Strategy**: Plan for validating implementation against requirements

## Example

**Input**: "Help me implement user authentication based on the provided security spec"

**Output**:
- **Requirements Analysis**: Breakdown of authentication requirements, security constraints, and compliance needs
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step approach to implement login, registration, and security features
- **Traceability Matrix**: Mapping between security requirements and authentication components
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions for successful authentication and security compliance
- **Compliance Report**: Verification checklist to ensure implementation meets security standards
